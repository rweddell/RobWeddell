README for 'Mazes' by Rob Weddell

This is an attempt to follow along in the book 'Mazes for Programmers'
by Jamis Buck. The code in the book is written using Ruby, but I wanted to 
complete the exercises using Python to introduce myself to the language.

I am relatively new to Python, so this has been a little bit of a struggle, 
but progress is ongoing and I intend to finish the book.
